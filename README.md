# Fitness Tracker (FitX)

## Overview
FitX is an advanced fitness tracking application built using React and TensorFlow.js for real-time pose estimation. The application helps users monitor their workouts, set fitness goals, and track progress with AI-powered assistance. It offers an interactive workout experience with guided commands and video instructions.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication using Supabase.
- **Dashboard**: After logging in, users are directed to the dashboard where the pose estimation model is initiated.
- **Pose Estimation**: Uses TensorFlow.js for real-time workout tracking and feedback.
- **Workout Selection**: Users can choose from different predefined workout models.
- **Live Camera Integration**: The app opens the camera to track movements and provide real-time guidance.
- **Workout Assistance**: Video tutorials and voice commands assist users during workouts.
- **Goal Setting**: Users can set fitness goals and monitor progress.
- **Timer Functionality**: A built-in timer helps users manage workout duration.
- **Custom Exercises**: Users can create and customize their own exercises.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Authentication**: Supabase
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js (Pose Estimation)
- **Database**: Supabase


## **Project Structure**
- `App.js`: Handles routing and authentication.
- `Dashboard.js`: The main workout interface where users can select plans, perform exercises, and track their progress.
- `ExerciseSelector.js`: Allows users to select and customize workouts.
- `exerciseConfigs.js`: Contains predefined configurations for exercises.
- `Auth.js`: Handles user authentication (login/register).
- `Home.js`: The landing page of the app.


## **1. App.js - Routing & Authentication**

### **Purpose:**
- Manages navigation between different pages.
- Implements protected routes using Supabase authentication.

### **Key Features:**
- Uses `react-router-dom` for navigation.
- Checks user authentication before accessing the `Dashboard`.
- Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

```javascript
function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
  const user = supabase.auth.getUser();
  return user ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
}
```

## **2. Dashboard.js - Core Workout Component**

### **Purpose:**
- Displays workout options.
- Allows users to select a plan or create a custom workout.
- Integrates TensorFlow.js for exercise recognition.
- Tracks and displays workout progress.

### **Key Features:**
1. **Workout Selection:**
   - Users choose between predefined workout plans or create their own.
   - Custom workouts allow users to manually select exercises and set repetitions or duration.

2. **TensorFlow.js Integration:**
   - The system uses a TensorFlow.js model to analyze user movements through a webcam.
   - The model tracks body posture and counts repetitions.
   - Integration is handled using `@tensorflow-models/posenet`.

3. **Real-Time Progress Tracking:**
   - Circular progress bars indicate exercise completion.
   - Users receive real-time feedback on form and repetition count.

4. **Exercise Execution:**
   - Each exercise has predefined configurations (`EXERCISE_CONFIGS`).
   - The app provides instructions, timers, and video demonstrations.

### **TensorFlow.js Integration:**
#### **How It Works:**
- Uses PoseNet to detect body keypoints.
- Determines exercise state based on predefined angles.
- Counts reps when the movement transitions between defined `up` and `down` states.

```javascript
const poseNetModel = await posenet.load();
const pose = await poseNetModel.estimateSinglePose(videoElement, { flipHorizontal: false });
```
- The detected pose is analyzed to match predefined exercise criteria.

## **3. ExerciseSelector.js - Custom Workout Selection**

### **Purpose:**
- Allows users to choose individual exercises and customize reps, sets, or duration.

### **Key Features:**
- Uses `useState` to track user settings.
- Enables selecting exercises from a predefined list (`EXERCISE_CONFIGS`).
- Allows customization of exercise parameters.

```javascript
const handleSettingChange = (exerciseId, field, value) => {
  const numericValue = Math.max(1, parseInt(value) || 1);
  setCustomSettings(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [exerciseId]: { ...prev[exerciseId], [field]: numericValue }
  }));
};
```

## **4. exerciseConfigs.js - Exercise Definitions**

### **Purpose:**
- Defines exercises, including movement ranges, muscles worked, and calorie estimates.

### **Key Features:**
- Contains exercise metadata, including start positions and angles.
- Provides instructions for correct form.
- Defines calorie expenditure per repetition.

```javascript
export const EXERCISE_CONFIGS = {
  push_up: {
    start_state: 'up',
    up_angle: 170,
    down_angle: 90,
    instructions: 'Maintain straight body line, lower chest to floor',
    muscles: 'Chest, Shoulders, Triceps',
  },
};
```
